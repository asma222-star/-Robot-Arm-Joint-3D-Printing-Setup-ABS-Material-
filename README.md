 Robot Arm Joint – 3D Printing Setup (ABS Material)

 # 🛠️ Robot Arm Joint – 3D Printing Setup (ABS Material)

This ## 📌 Overview
document describes the configuration and optimization steps for 3D printing a **robot arm joint** using **ABS filament** on **eufyMake Studio (PrusaSlicer-based)**. The profile is tuned for **high strength and durability** to withstand mechanical loads in robotic arm applications.

## 🎯 Reason for Choosing ABS
- ** Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene 
  ABS  is the most suitable material for manufacturing the robotic arm fixture. Considering the application of arm robot such as coffee barista, it strength is suitable to withstand the moments and stress resulting from the required operations while having an adequate and moderate heat resistance. Also, there are no requirements for chemical resistance since there is no potential of chemical attacks.
   
so ABS have the following
- **High Strength:** ABS provides better mechanical properties than PLA, making it suitable for load-bearing robotic parts.  
- **Heat Resistance:** ABS withstands higher operating temperatures (~100°C), preventing deformation during use.  
- **Impact Resistance:** Less brittle compared to PLA, making joints more durable under repetitive stress.  
- **Post-Processing:** Can be acetone-smoothed or annealed for extra strength and smoother finishes.  

## ⚙️ Printer & Filament Setup

## ✅ Printing Steps
1. Switch to **Expert Mode** in eufyMake Studio.  
2. Create a new filament profile → name it **ABS Robot Joint**.  
3. Apply the settings from each tab as listed above.  
4. Slice the model and preview supports and walls.  
5. Print a small calibration test, then print the full joint.
